As an example, an additional 20\% owner would take 5\% of 20\% of the interest percentage from a 5\% owner, leaving him with 4\%. 
In this same example, a 95\% owner would yield 95\% of 20\% of his interest percentage, leaving him with 76\%. 
A decision of the Managers to add a Member would require this contribution from all current Members, regardless of consent.

\subsection{Managers}

The Company will be Manager-Managed. A Manager is also a Member, but a Member is not necessarily a Manager. The name, present mailing address, initial capital contributions, and percentage interest of each Manager is set forth in \sa{}, as amended from time to time.

	\item all Members must have an opportunity to contribute a proportional amount, such that their percentage Interest is maintained; and
	\item the contributing Member will be assigned Interest based on the current valuation of the Company, which will be determined by the Managers. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{}

The Company shall have the first option to purchase the Interest from the transferor on the terms listed in the Offer. The Company shall have thirty (30) days after the receipt of the Offer to exercise its option to purchase by providing written notice to the transferor.

\subsubsection{}

If the Company fails to notify the transferring Member of its desire to exercise its option, then the Company will be deemed to have waived its right to acquire the Interest on the terms described in the Offer and the transferring Member may sell and convey the Interest consistent with the Offer to another Member of the Company; provided, however, if the sale to another Member is made on terms that are more favorable then stated in the original Offer, the transferring Member must reoffer the sale of the Interest to the Company at the new terms and price prior to offering it to another Member.

\subsubsection{}

The Member desiring to purchase the Interest from the transferring Member shall have thirty (30) days after the receipt of the Offer to exercises his/her option by providing written notice to the transferor.

\subsubsection{}

In the event that neither the Company nor the other Members elect to purchase the Interest, the transferring Member may sell and convey the interest consistent with the Offer to any other person or entity with the approval of the non-transferring Members, provided that such Transfer shall be made on terms no more favorable than offered to the Company and its Members. The transferee shall retain only economic rights in the Company and shall not be admitted as a full Member without the unanimous written approval of the non-transferring Member(s).

\subsubsection{}

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of \autoref{sec:rightoffirstrefusal}, should the remaining Member be entitled to and elect to acquire all the Interests of the other Members of the Company in accordance with the provisions of \autoref{sec:rightoffirstrefusal}, such that the Company becomes a single Member Limited Liability Company, the acquiring Member may assign the right to acquire Interests to a spouse, lineal descendent, or an affiliated entity if the assignment is reasonably believed to be necessary to continue the existence of the Company as a Limited Liability Company.

\subsection{Invalid Transfer of Interest}

Each Member hereby acknowledges that any transfer of any Interest or portion thereof in violation of the term of \autoref{sec:transfersassignmentandwithdrawal} shall be deemed invalid, null and void, and of no force or effect.
